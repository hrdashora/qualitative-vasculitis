# Qualitative Analysis of Vasculitis - Web App
RShiny app that tracks AVaDaS (Angiogram Vascular Damage Score) and PETVAS (PET Vascular Activity Score) per patient.

## General Info
Qualitative scoring systems offer a rapid method by which to assess radiological scans like angiograms and PET. Grayson Lab scores radiological scans of vasculitis patients with such methods in an effort to monitor recovery and predict outcomes. This Web App imports the scores from formatted CSV files to aid in visualization.
### AVaDaS: Angiogram Vascular Damage Score
Baseline angiograms are visually inspected for the presence of an Anuerysm, Stenosis, or Occlusion in 17 arterial territories. The presence of one of these lesion types is marked as a '1' on for that particular territory. Follow-up angiograms are evaluated in a similar manner. If the same lesion is present in the same territory for both scans, the score is augmented with a 'Better/Worse/Same' to indicate the change in the lesion severity over time.
